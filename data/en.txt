GENERAL PROPERTIES
Description
Luminex chloride is a blue liquid.
Solid State Forms
One non-solvated, anhydrous solid state form, Form A, has been obtained for all nonclinical, clinical and production batches.
Form A is the most thermodynamically stable form known.
Luminex chloride can also form three other polymorphs and several solvates.
The defined manufacturing processing conditions consistently deliver Form A, as confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD).
An example XRPD pattern of luminex chloride is shown in Figure 1.
Hydrated versions of luminex chloride also exist, but there is no evidence of their formation during the manufacturing process or during stability studies.
The drug substance is size reduced by nanofiltration prior to drug product manufacture.
Nanofiltered and non-nanofiltered drug substance display the same X-ray powder diffraction pattern.
pKa
pKa of 13.5 has been estimated by software for the hydroxyl group.
pH
7.8 to 7.9 for 15% suspension in water at 25°C.
Partition Coefficient (Log P)
Log P of 0.1234 has been determined at 25°C in iso-octane/aqueous buffer at pH 8.
Melting Point
Form A exhibits a melt onset at approximately 252°C as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
Degradation occurs post-melt.
An overlay of DSC and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data is shown in Figure 2.

Moisture Sorption
Luminex chloride exhibits limited water adsorption, typically absorbing approximately 0.2% w/w water between 0 and 95% relative humidity at 30°C by Gravimetric Vapour Sorption (GVS).
No solid state changes occur over this range.
Crystallinity
Form A is crystalline, as confirmed by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (see Figure 1).
Crystal Habit
Luminex chloride exhibits a rod habit.
When nanofiltered, spherical shaped particles result.
Particle Size
The particle size of luminex chloride is reduced by nanofiltration to produce material appropriate for delivery by the oral route.
A detailed discussion of the particle size specification of drug substance is provided in Section 4.5.
